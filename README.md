<h1>iEdit.</h1>

<p>
iEdit is a JavaScript library which allows you to add an image cropping and modifying interface to your website. You no longer need to create advanced image processing scripts in WebGL; all you need to do is provide iEdit with the image files and deal with the image modified by the user. No need to make your own interface or hassle around with aspect ratios, resolutions and file types; iEdit has you covered. Just include the script and the style files and call the functions. That is it.

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use iEdit, just include iEdit's script file and the style file. <b>jQuery</b> is the only dependancy and must included as well.
